# muxm Format Profiles

`muxm` ships six opinionated profiles, listed below from highest fidelity to widest
compatibility. Each profile is a starting point — every variable it sets can be
overridden from a `.muxmrc` config file or from the CLI.

To inspect the exact variables a profile sets (including any overrides you've
applied), use:

```bash
muxm --profile <name> --print-effective-config
```

## Choosing a Profile

| Profile | Container | Codec | Audio | Use when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dv-archival` | MKV | copy | lossless copy | You want a bit-perfect archive with DV + HDR10 intact. |
| `hdr10-hq` | MKV | HEVC | lossless + stereo | Your gear is HDR10 but not Dolby Vision. |
| `atv-directplay-hq` | MP4 | HEVC | E-AC-3 + stereo | Plex → Apple TV 4K and you never want transcoding. |
| `streaming` | MP4 | HEVC | E-AC-3 + stereo | Plex/Jellyfin on mixed modern clients; file size matters. |
| `animation` | MKV | HEVC | lossless + stereo | Anime or cartoons where banding and styled subs matter. |
| `universal` | MP4 | H.264 | AAC stereo | It has to play everywhere, including old Rokus and phones. |

## Profile Details

### 1) `dv-archival` — High Quality Dolby Vision Archival

**For:** Collectors and Plex users with a Dolby Vision ecosystem (Apple TV 4K +
DV display, Shield, LG WebOS) who want to preserve original quality for long-term
storage.

**Goal:** Lossless remux only. Preserve Dolby Vision + HDR10 metadata, keep all
audio tracks (multi-track copy, no transcode), keep all subtitle tracks, keep
chapters and metadata. Skip processing entirely if the file already matches the
target. Generate a JSON report and SHA-256 checksum for archival integrity.

**Key behaviors:**

- Video is stream-copied, never re-encoded (unless the source is non-compliant
  and a re-encode is explicitly requested via CLI override).
- All audio tracks matching the language filter are copied losslessly. Commentary
  tracks are excluded by default.
- All subtitle tracks are kept (up to `SUB_MAX_TRACKS`, default 99). Forced
  tracks are detected and flagged. Language tags are normalized.
- The skip-if-ideal heuristic avoids touching files that already conform.

**CLI:** `muxm --profile dv-archival input.mkv`

---

### 2) `hdr10-hq` — High Quality HDR10 (No Dolby Vision)

**For:** HDR10 displays and mixed-device setups where Dolby Vision causes playback
quirks (older streaming devices, non-DV TVs, varied Plex clients).

**Goal:** Maximum HDR10 quality. Strip DV layers, preserve HDR10 static metadata,
re-encode to HEVC Main10 at high quality (CRF 17 / slower), keep lossless audio
with an AAC stereo fallback for lightweight clients.

**Key behaviors:**

- DV is stripped unconditionally. If the source is DV-only (no HDR10 fallback
  layer), `muxm` warns that the output may appear dim or washed out.
- Full HDR10 x265 parameter set is applied (colorimetry, mastering display,
  MaxCLL passthrough).
- Pixel format forced to `yuv420p10le`.

**CLI:** `muxm --profile hdr10-hq input.mkv`

---

### 3) `atv-directplay-hq` — Apple TV Direct Play (Plex) Optimized

**For:** Plex → Apple TV 4K setups aiming for true Direct Play with zero
transcoding.

**Goal:** Conform to tvOS and Plex playback constraints while keeping high
quality. MP4 container, HEVC Main10, DV Profile 8.1 when possible (with clean
HDR10 fallback), E-AC-3 audio (with Atmos JOC when present), AAC stereo
fallback, and text-based subtitles.

**Key behaviors:**

- DV Profile 8.1 is preserved if the source is compliant; otherwise falls back
  to clean HDR10. Profile 7 FEL sources are not output as P7.
- Video is stream-copied when already compliant (bitrate and codec checks
  included); otherwise re-encoded at CRF 17 / slower with level 5.1 VBV
  constraints.
- Surround audio is transcoded to E-AC-3 (Apple TV cannot Direct Play TrueHD).
- Forced subtitles are burned into the video. All others are embedded as
  `mov_text`.
- The skip-if-ideal heuristic avoids re-processing compliant files.

**CLI:** `muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq input.mkv`

---

### 4) `streaming` — Modern HEVC Streaming

**For:** Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby users targeting modern clients — Shield, Fire
TV, Roku Ultra, smart TVs, and web browsers. Balances quality with file size.

**Goal:** Smaller files with broad modern-device support. HEVC CRF 20 / medium,
HDR10 preserved, DV stripped, E-AC-3 surround at streaming-friendly bitrates, AAC
stereo fallback.

**Key behaviors:**

- DV is stripped; HDR10 metadata is kept.
- Audio is transcoded to E-AC-3 at reduced bitrates (448k for 5.1, 640k for
  7.1) plus a 192k AAC stereo track.
- Subtitles are soft-embedded (forced + full, no SDH, no burn).
- Chapters and metadata are preserved.

**CLI:** `muxm --profile streaming input.mkv`

---

### 5) `animation` — Anime & Cartoon Optimized

**For:** Anime and cartoon content where banding-free gradients, clean hard edges,
and styled subtitle preservation matter. Ideal for archival-quality animation
encodes.

**Goal:** Artifact-free animation encoding. HEVC at CRF 16 / slower with
animation-tuned x265 parameters (reduced psy-rd, lowered aq-strength, adjusted
deblock, extra b-frames). 10-bit output unconditionally — even for 8-bit SDR
sources — to eliminate banding. MKV container to support styled ASS/SSA
subtitles and lossless audio.

**Key behaviors:**

- 10-bit pixel depth is forced for all sources regardless of input bit depth.
  This is the primary defense against gradient banding in flat-shaded animation.
- Lossless audio is copied through (FLAC-first codec preference for typical
  anime releases), with a 192k AAC stereo fallback.
- Multi-track subtitles are kept (up to 6 tracks). Native ASS/SSA formatting
  is preserved instead of converting to SRT. Subtitles are never burned.
- Chapters are kept (OP/ED markers).

**CLI:** `muxm --profile animation input.mkv`

---

### 6) `universal` — Universal Compatibility

**For:** Playback anywhere — old Rokus, mobile devices, web browsers, non-HDR TVs.
Sharing with friends and family who shouldn't have to think about playback
capability.

**Goal:** Compatibility over fidelity. Tone-map HDR to SDR, encode to H.264, AAC
stereo audio, burn forced subtitles, export the rest as external `.srt` files,
strip chapters and non-essential metadata.

**Key behaviors:**

- HDR sources are tone-mapped to SDR via zscale + hable.
- All audio is forced to AAC stereo at 256k (no surround output).
- Forced subtitles are burned. Non-forced subs are exported as `.srt` sidecar
  files. SDH tracks are excluded.
- Chapters and non-essential metadata are stripped.

**CLI:** `muxm --profile universal input.mkv`

---

## Configuration Precedence

`muxm` reads configuration from multiple levels, applied in this order (each
layer overrides the one before it):

1. **Hardcoded defaults** — built into the script (Section 4)
2. **System config** — `/etc/.muxmrc`
3. **User config** — `~/.muxmrc`
4. **Project config** — `./.muxmrc` (in the current working directory)
5. **Profile** — `--profile <name>` (or `PROFILE_NAME` set in a config file)
6. **CLI flags** — command-line arguments (highest precedence)

### Setting a Default Profile

```bash
# In ~/.muxmrc
PROFILE_NAME="atv-directplay-hq"
```

`--profile` on the CLI always overrides a `PROFILE_NAME` set in a config file.

### Generating a Config File

```bash
muxm --create-config user streaming
```

This writes a `~/.muxmrc` pre-filled with the `streaming` profile's defaults.
Profile-specific variables are uncommented and active; everything else is
commented out for you to customize. Valid scopes are `system`, `user`, and
`project`.

### Verifying the Effective Configuration

```bash
muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq --crf 20 --print-effective-config
```

Shows every variable grouped by section, which profile is active, and each
value's source (`cli`, `config-file`, or `profile`).

### Override Example

```bash
# User config sets a default profile
# ~/.muxmrc: PROFILE_NAME="hdr10-hq"

# CLI overrides CRF and container
muxm --profile hdr10-hq --crf 20 --output-ext mp4 input.mkv
```

Result: `hdr10-hq` profile with `CRF_VALUE=20` and `OUTPUT_EXT=mp4`. The CLI
flags win.

## Conflict Warnings

`muxm` detects contradictory profile + flag combinations and prints warnings.
Warnings never block execution — the user's CLI flags always win.

Examples:

```
muxm --profile dv-archival --no-dv input.mkv
# ⚠️  Profile 'dv-archival' + --no-dv: DV archival without Dolby Vision is pointless.
#     Output will be a plain remux.

muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq --output-ext mkv input.mkv
# ⚠️  Profile 'atv-directplay-hq' + --output-ext mkv: MKV does not Direct Play
#     on Apple TV. Use mp4 for ATV compatibility.

muxm --profile animation --sub-burn-forced input.mkv
# ⚠️  Profile 'animation' + --sub-burn-forced: Burning subs destroys ASS styling
#     (typesetting, signs, karaoke). Soft subs recommended.

muxm --profile universal --video-codec libx265 input.mkv
# ⚠️  Profile 'universal' + --video-codec libx265: HEVC is less widely supported
#     than H.264 for universal playback.
```

The full set of checked conflicts is in Section 13 of the script.
