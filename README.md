# ![muxm](./assets/muxm_header_small.png) MuxMaster

**MuxMaster** (`muxm`) — a single-command video repacking and encoding utility that handles Dolby Vision, HDR10, audio track selection, subtitle processing, and container muxing so you don't have to. Pick a profile, point it at a file, and get a properly encoded output without memorizing ffmpeg flags.

```bash
# Install dependencies (macOS/Linux)
muxm --install-dependencies

# Encode for Apple TV Direct Play — that's it
muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq movie.mkv
```

## 💡 Why MuxMaster? <a id="why"></a>

Getting a Blu-ray rip to play correctly on an Apple TV, a Roku, or through Plex without transcoding is a surprisingly deep problem. The video might be Dolby Vision Profile 7 that needs conversion to Profile 8.1. The audio might be TrueHD, which your player can't direct-play, so you need E-AC-3 — but you also want a stereo AAC fallback for when you're watching on a phone. The forced subtitles need to be burned in because MP4 containers don't handle PGS bitmaps. And the color space metadata needs to survive the whole process.

You can solve all of this with raw ffmpeg, but the command will be 15+ flags long, different for every source file, and you'll need to inspect the source with ffprobe first to decide what half of those flags should be. Every new file is a new puzzle.

**HandBrake** is the go-to GUI for video encoding, and it's excellent for what it does. But its preset system doesn't adapt to what's actually in the file. It can't detect that your source is already Apple TV-compliant and skip the encode. It doesn't extract Dolby Vision RPUs, convert between DV profiles, or inject them back into re-encoded video. It won't selectively OCR your PGS subtitles to SRT when the output container can't carry bitmaps. And it won't generate a JSON report of everything it did for your records. HandBrake gives you a good encode; MuxMaster gives you an opinionated pipeline that understands the relationship between your source, your target device, and every stream in the file.

**Tdarr** solves the batch-processing and automation problem well, especially at library scale. But it requires a server, a database, a web UI, and Node.js — it's infrastructure. If you want to process a single file, or a handful of files, with precise control over DV handling, audio track selection, and subtitle policy, Tdarr's plugin system means writing JavaScript to configure what `muxm` handles with a single `--profile` flag. Tdarr is a media library manager; MuxMaster is a per-file encoding tool that aims to make every decision correctly so you don't have to inspect the output.

MuxMaster sits in the gap between "I know ffmpeg well enough to do this manually" and "I need a server-based automation platform." It's a single Bash script with no runtime dependencies beyond ffmpeg and jq, it understands Dolby Vision at the RPU level, and its profile system encodes the tribal knowledge of what actually works on real hardware into repeatable, overridable presets.

## 🎯 Format Profiles <a id="profiles"></a>

Profiles are named presets that configure `muxm` for a specific use case in a single flag. Every setting a profile changes can be individually overridden with CLI flags.

```bash
muxm --profile <name> input.mkv
```

| Profile | Goal | Container | Video | Audio | DV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dv-archival` | Lossless preservation | MKV | Copy (no re-encode) | Lossless passthrough | Preserve |
| `hdr10-hq` | Max HDR10 quality | MKV | HEVC CRF 17 | Lossless + stereo fallback | Strip |
| `atv-directplay-hq` | Apple TV Direct Play | MP4 | HEVC Main10 (copy if compliant) | E-AC-3 + AAC stereo | P8.1 auto |
| `streaming` | Modern HEVC streaming | MP4 | HEVC CRF 20 | E-AC-3 448k + AAC stereo | Strip |
| `animation` | Anime/cartoon optimized | MKV | HEVC CRF 16, 10-bit | Lossless + stereo fallback | Strip |
| `universal` | Play anywhere | MP4 | H.264 SDR (tone-map HDR) | AAC stereo | Strip |

### `dv-archival` — Dolby Vision Archival

For collectors who want bit-perfect preservation. Copies video without re-encoding, passes lossless audio through, keeps all subtitles and chapters, and generates a JSON report. Skips processing entirely if the source already matches.

```bash
muxm --profile dv-archival movie.mkv
```

### `hdr10-hq` — High Quality HDR10

Strips Dolby Vision layers and re-encodes to clean HDR10 HEVC at CRF 17. Preserves lossless audio (TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, FLAC) and adds a stereo fallback track. MKV output.

```bash
muxm --profile hdr10-hq movie.mkv
```

### `atv-directplay-hq` — Apple TV Direct Play

Targets true Direct Play on Apple TV 4K via Plex: MP4 container, HEVC Main10 with DV Profile 8.1 when possible, E-AC-3 surround with AAC stereo fallback, and forced subtitle burn-in. Copies compliant video without re-encoding. Skips processing if source is already ATV-compliant.

```bash
muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq movie.mkv
```

### `streaming` — Modern HEVC Streaming

Optimized for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby on modern clients: Shield, Fire TV, Roku Ultra, smart TVs, and web browsers. HEVC CRF 20 with E-AC-3 surround at streaming-friendly bitrates, AAC stereo fallback, and soft subtitles. Strips DV and keeps HDR10. Balances quality with file size.

```bash
muxm --profile streaming movie.mkv
```

### `animation` — Anime & Cartoon Optimized

Tuned for animation content: lower psy-rd/psy-rdoq to avoid ringing on hard cel edges, 10-bit even for SDR to eliminate banding in gradients, and lossless audio passthrough. MKV container preserves styled ASS/SSA subtitles. Keeps all subtitle tracks (up to 6) and chapter markers.

```bash
muxm --profile animation movie.mkv
```

### `universal` — Universal Compatibility

Plays on everything: old Rokus, mobile devices, web browsers, non-HDR TVs. Tone-maps HDR to SDR, encodes to H.264, forces AAC stereo audio, burns forced subtitles, exports others as external SRT, and strips chapters and non-essential metadata.

```bash
muxm --profile universal movie.mkv
```

### Overriding Profile Defaults

Profiles are starting points — every setting can be overridden with CLI flags:

```bash
# Use hdr10-hq but with a different CRF and no stereo fallback
muxm --profile hdr10-hq --crf 20 --no-stereo-fallback movie.mkv

# Use universal but keep chapters
muxm --profile universal --keep-chapters movie.mkv

# Use atv-directplay-hq but output to MKV (you'll get a warning)
muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq --output-ext mkv movie.mkv
```

## 🔧 How It Works <a id="howitworks"></a>

When you run `muxm`, the script executes a multi-stage pipeline that inspects the source file, makes codec and container decisions based on the active profile, processes each stream type independently, and assembles the final output. Here's what happens under the hood:

**1. Source Inspection.** `muxm` calls ffprobe once and caches the full JSON metadata for the source file. Every subsequent decision — codec detection, color space identification, audio channel layout, subtitle format — reads from this cache rather than re-probing.

**2. Profile Resolution.** Settings are resolved through a layered precedence chain: hardcoded defaults → system config (`/etc/.muxmrc`) → user config (`~/.muxmrc`) → project config (`./.muxmrc`) → profile → CLI flags. Contradictory combinations (like `--profile dv-archival --no-dv`) trigger warnings but never errors — CLI flags always win.

**3. Video Pipeline.** The video stage handles the most complexity. It detects Dolby Vision by probing both stream metadata and frame-level side data, then identifies the DV profile (5, 7, or 8) and compatibility ID. For profiles that preserve DV, it extracts the RPU (Reference Processing Unit) via `dovi_tool`, converts between DV profiles when necessary (e.g., Profile 7 dual-layer → Profile 8.1 single-layer), encodes the base layer with x265, and injects the RPU back into the encoded stream. For non-DV profiles, it detects the source color space (BT.2020 PQ, BT.2020 HLG, or BT.709 SDR), sets the matching x265 color parameters and pixel format, and applies tone-mapping when the profile targets SDR output.

**4. Audio Pipeline.** Audio track selection is language-preference-aware and codec-aware. The pipeline picks the best available track (honoring `--audio-lang-pref`), decides whether to copy it through or transcode it based on the profile's codec requirements, and optionally generates a stereo AAC fallback track from the surround source. Lossless codecs (TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, FLAC) are passed through untouched when the profile and container support it.

**5. Subtitle Pipeline.** Subtitles are categorized into forced, full, and SDH tracks. PGS bitmap subtitles are OCR'd to SRT (via `pgsrip` or `sub2srt`) when the output container can't carry them natively. Forced subtitles can be burned into the video stream; other tracks can be embedded or exported as external `.srt` files. The pipeline respects language preferences and can exclude SDH tracks.

**6. Final Mux.** All processed streams are assembled into the target container (MP4, MKV, M4V, or MOV) with correct codec tagging, chapter markers, subtitle disposition flags, and metadata. For Dolby Vision in MP4, `muxm` verifies that the `dvcC`/`dvvC` container signaling record is present via `MP4Box`.

**7. Verification.** The output file is validated with ffprobe to confirm it's non-empty and parseable. Optionally, a SHA-256 checksum is written and a JSON report is generated documenting every decision, warning, and stream mapping from the run.

If any stage fails, `muxm` logs the failure, cleans up incomplete temp files, and exits with a descriptive error code. The `--dry-run` flag executes the entire decision pipeline without writing real output, so you can preview exactly what `muxm` would do before committing to an encode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theBluWiz/muxmaster.git
cd muxmaster
chmod +x muxm
muxm --install-dependencies     # installs ffmpeg, jq, dovi_tool, etc.
muxm --profile atv-directplay-hq movie.mkv
```

Optionally, move `muxm` into your PATH:

```bash
sudo cp muxm /usr/local/bin/muxm
```

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- **ffmpeg** and **ffprobe** – core encoding and media inspection
- **jq** – JSON parsing for stream metadata and reporting

**Optional (auto-disabled if missing):**

## ⚙️ Configuration <a id="configuration"></a>

`muxm` reads configuration from multiple levels, applied in this order (lowest → highest precedence):

```
Hardcoded defaults
  → /etc/.muxmrc          (system-wide)
    → ~/.muxmrc            (user defaults)
      → ./.muxmrc          (project-specific)
        → --profile <name> (format profile)
          → CLI flags      (highest — always wins)
```

### Setting a Default Profile

Add to any `.muxmrc` file:

```bash
# ~/.muxmrc — always use Apple TV Direct Play unless overridden
PROFILE_NAME="atv-directplay-hq"
```

CLI `--profile` always overrides a config-file `PROFILE_NAME`.

### Creating a Config File

Use `--create-config` to generate a full `.muxmrc` file pre-configured for a specific profile:

```bash
muxm --create-config <scope> [profile]
```

| Scope | Path | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `system` | `/etc/.muxmrc` | Organization-wide defaults (requires sudo) |
| `user` | `~/.muxmrc` | Personal defaults across all projects |
| `project` | `$PWD/.muxmrc` | Per-project settings |

The generated file contains the complete config template. Variables set by the chosen profile are uncommented and active; everything else is commented with defaults for easy customization.

Profile defaults to `atv-directplay-hq` if omitted. Use `--force-create-config` to overwrite an existing file.

### Verifying Effective Configuration

```bash
# See what the resolved config looks like after all sources merge
muxm --profile hdr10-hq --crf 20 --print-effective-config
```

This shows every variable grouped by section, the active profile name, and whether the profile came from a config file or the CLI.

## 📋 Also Includes <a id="alsoincludes"></a>

Beyond profiles and the core encoding pipeline, `muxm` ships with a set of operational features that make it safer and easier to use in practice:

- **Skip-if-Ideal** – Before encoding, `muxm` inspects the source to determine if it already matches the target profile. If it does, the file is linked or copied without re-encoding, saving time and avoiding generation loss. Enabled per-profile or via `--skip-if-ideal`.

- **Conflict Warnings** – Running `--profile dv-archival --no-dv` doesn't error out — it warns you that the combination is contradictory and proceeds with your explicit flags taking precedence. The tool trusts you but lets you know when something looks wrong.

- **Dry-Run Mode** – `--dry-run` executes the entire decision pipeline (profile resolution, codec detection, DV identification, audio selection) and prints what it would do, without writing any output files.

- **JSON Reporting** – `--report-json` generates a machine-readable JSON report alongside the output file, documenting every decision, warning, codec mapping, and stream disposition from the run.

- **Checksum Verification** – Optionally writes a SHA-256 checksum file for the output to verify integrity after transfer or archival.

- **Error Recovery & Cleanup** – If any pipeline stage fails, `muxm` logs the failure with context, cleans up incomplete temp files from the working directory, and exits with a descriptive error code.

- **Color Space Matching** – For non-DV encodes, `muxm` reads the source color primaries, transfer characteristics, and matrix coefficients, then sets matching x265 parameters and pixel format automatically.

- **Tone-Mapping** – Converts HDR10 or HLG content to SDR using a zscale + hable filter chain when the profile targets H.264 or SDR output.

- **PGS Subtitle OCR** – When the output container can't carry PGS bitmap subtitles (MP4, MOV), `muxm` attempts OCR via `pgsrip` or `sub2srt` to produce SRT equivalents.

- **Man Page** – `muxm --install-man` installs a full `muxm(1)` manual page with complete flag reference, profile documentation, and examples accessible via `man muxm`.
